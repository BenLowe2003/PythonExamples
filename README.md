# PythonExamples

I've put together some example programs for python. Here is a short description of Each.

EuclidAlg.py - Implementation of euclids algorithm to find the highest common factor and lowest common multiple of two numbers

GradDecent.py - I wrote an algorithm for approximating the potential barrier in inverse scattering problems. This is a generalisation of that algorithm to an arbitrary test functional.

PrimesOneLine.py - A program to sieve all the prime numbers upto n in one line, It's also a constructive definition of the prime numbers.

U_approximation.py - A program to approximate the potential berrier in back scattering problems modeled using pade polynomials.

V(x)Graph.py - Prints a graph of a wave funtion within a square potential barrier, well and the barrier its self.

dice_expectations.py - MonteCarlo approximation for the distribution of rolling n dice and counting the number of rolls above a success parameter.

nBodyRungeKutta.py - An n body simulation with examples of newtonian gravitational forces utilising runge-kutta integration and the graphics module to generate a graphical representation.

skibidifizzbuzz.py - Some examples of solutions to problems in my computational mathematics module.

Prime_Num_Generator - Nieve attempt to implement the euclian algorithm, a better implementaion can be found in my prime number sieve repo

WaveEquasionIntegrator - Eulerian method for integrating the wave equasion from initial conditions at f(x,y,z) at t = 0.
